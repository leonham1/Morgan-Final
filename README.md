# Data
The data we collected was from the 119th Congress for the 2025-2026 year. For this study we gathered information on the Congress people's political party as they register. We also gatehred information about what gender they identify as.
#Opperalization
We started by taking the public information about each member's political party and coded it. 1 was coded as republicans, 2 as democrat, adn 3 as other which encompasses all those who do not identify with either main stream party. This took the broad spectrum of political beliefs and grouped them generally.
Gender was opperationalized by each members public gender identity. We coded this as 0 represented a woman, 1 represented a man, and 2 represented those who do not identify with either female or male. We made sure to make the variable like this to be exhaustive.
Each row on the table represented a single member of Congress
To ultimatley determine if there is a relationship between the two variables I ran a Chi-Square test to determine if the differences between variables were associated or put together by chance.
